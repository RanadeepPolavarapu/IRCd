ABOUT
======
This module adds a new extban type ~T by which you can take various
actions upon specified words/text.

The syntax is: ~T:<action>:<wildcardexpression>
For example:   ~T:block:*fuck*

Note that channel operators (halfop and above) are exempted from filtering.

Valid actions (IF enabled!) are:

block
------
This will simply block the whole line of text and inform the user.

Ex:
[15:03:13] * Zwei sets mode: +b ~T:block:*test*
[15:03:19] <Ein> test
#blah Message blocked due to a text ban (#blah)


censor
-------
This will replace the matched word with <censored> (=configurable in
the module).

Ex:
[15:03:13] * Zwei sets mode: +b ~T:censor:*test*
[15:03:19] <Ein> this is a test
will appear as:
[15:03:19] <Ein> this is a <censored>

ADDITIONAL NOTES
=================

UHOST FEATURE
--------------
If UHOSTFEATURE is enabled (see .c file), then the syntax is different:
Then the syntax is: ~T:<uhost>:<action>:<wildcardexpression>
And for example:    ~T:*@*.aol.com:block:*fuck*

OTHER REMARKS
--------------

- Regexes are not accepted (because of being dangerous and slow)
- The 'censor' action (currently) only allow "simple matches",
  which means only word*, *word, *word, word, *word* are accepted,
  and not *wo*rd* or *wo??r* and such things.
  This could be improved one day, but the current match options are in
  many cases sufficient, and not implementing the more complex actions can
  save a lot of CPU.
- For the 'block' action, the text is matched against the entire sentence,
  so in this case you can freely use '*' and '?' and as much as you want.
- For the 'block' action, you can use an underscore ('_') which will match
  both '_' and ' ' (space). This can be used to for example block "is using"
  by setting a +b ~T:block:*is_using*
- Colors and control codes (underline/bold/reverse) are stripped
  before we try to match, so they should not (and cannot) be
  specified in the +b ~T.
- Only messages from normal and voiced users are blocked/filtered,
  messages from halfops and higher are not.

NOTE ABOUT SPEED
=================
(figures below are with UHOSTFEATURE disabled)
The speed impact depends on several factors, like actions enabled, the
number of bans set, and more. Below we will try to give you the PEAK
numbers that a box of mine, an A1800+ (1.53GHz) can handle, those are
textbans that consume most CPU of all (like 510 byte messages, etc),
all using the default settings (like max 15 textbans per channel).

Note that messages are only processed (and thus consume CPU) if..:
- The channel has any textban
- The client the message is from is LOCAL
- The client the message is from is not an halfop or higher
- The client the message is from is not an IRCOp

So if you have 100 users in a channel, of which 25 on your server,
of which 20 are not a chanop/oper, then only for those 20 the
textbans will be checked.

Now, in-depth info per-action follows:

block
------
This is the fastest of all, and speed impact of this is hardly ever
a problem.

RAW PEAK: 42 usecs per-message peak with 15 bans, 510 byte messages
PEAK: The module is capable of processing ~20000 (20K) messages per second
RAW AVG: 10-12 usecs
AVG # OF LINES: 90K msgs/second
AVG: <0.5% CPU

censor
-------
This is slower than 'block' (about 3 times typical, 5 times peak).
Enabling/disabling this depends on the network, in many cases it should
be no problem.

RAW PEAK: 310 usec peak with 15 one-letter bans, 510 byte messages
PEAK: The module is capable of processing ~3000 (3K) messages per second
RAW AVG: 30 usec (9 normal bans, avg text lines)
AVG # OF LINES: 33K msgs/second
AVG: 0-2% CPU
