ABOUT
======
SUMMARY:
This module tries to detect semi-random nicks/idents/realnames,
therefore trying to get rid of some very annoying trojans/bots.

TERMS USED:
False positive = a user caught as "bad" while (s)he is not
False negative = a "bad" user that isn't caught.

DETAILS / WORDS OF CAUTION [!!PLEASE READ!!]:
Because users sometimes look like having a random nick/username
the ircd might catch some innocent users. Also, if you use for
example CGI:IRC then be careful because if you encode the host
in the ident part (aka: 'd030f03cd') then the module could catch
it as "random" and kill those poor users.

Several tests indicated that this module can be quite effective
against those bots and has few false positives, but it's impossible
to have 0 false positives, so expect to deal with it from time to
time that a poor user gets killed.

If you got (a lot of) non-English users with for example Russian,
Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, .. nicks/idents/realnames, then this
module might catch them as "random" too, because the rules we use
to call something random is based on the English language (although
I suspect it to work fine as well with many other western European
languages).

Feedback is always welcomed (syzop@vulnscan.org), both success
stories and problems.

PERFORMANCE
============
Since the module has to do ~500 (small) checks, this does not come
without any performance penalty.
That said, this module has been severely optimized and tests on my
AMD 1800+ (1.53GHz) show that it can process ~7000 local users/sec
(with near-100% CPU)..
So, if you got a fast GHz machine, you should be able to deal with
even the biggest attacks (as far as AntiRandom is concerned, at
least ;p).

The exception list of course also has a performance impact, but
thanks to it being ip/host only, it is not severe.
Tests on my AMD 1800+ show that for 20 entries (containing a mixture
of *.somehost.blah.net and 192.168.5.* etc) ~15 microseconds of CPU
was spent (worst-case).
So, unless you get like >100 entries, this shouldn't be any problem.
