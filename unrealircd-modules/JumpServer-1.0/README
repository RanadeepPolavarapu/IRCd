ABOUT
======
This module adds the ability to 'redirect' users to another server.
This is useful if you are going to take the server offline for
maintenance (eg: upgrading, server reboot, etc).

Any feedback is welcome! (syzop@unrealircd.com)

IMPORTANT NOTE / HOW IT WORKS:
 This module sends a RPL_REDIR (010) numeric which will redirect any people
 automatically to another server IF SUPPORTED BY THE CLIENT.
 It is currently only supported by a few clients like mIRC.
 People with other clients will however see the <reason> field every time
 they try to reconnect (bit like a gline) so they can understand what's going
 on and should be able to switch manually.

 Overall, using this module (like right before you are taking the server down
 for a long period) can be quite helpful in some cases.

The usage of the command is:
 /JUMPSERVER <server>[:port] <NEW|ALL> <reason>
If 'NEW' is chosen then only new (incoming) clients will be redirected/rejected.
If 'ALL' is chosen then ALL clients (except opers) are redirected immediately (+incomming).
and if you also want to specify an SSL server:
 /JUMPSERVER <server>[:port]/<sslserver>[:sslport]> <NEW|ALL> <reason>
If 'NEW' is chosen then only new (incoming) clients will be redirected/rejected.
If 'ALL' is chosen then ALL clients (except opers) are redirected immediately (+incomming).

 /JUMPSERVER
Will show the current status.

 /JUMPSERVER OFF
Will stop any redirects.

So you could for example use the module like this:
 /msg OperServ GLOBAL blah.testnet.com is going down for maintenance, please switch to another server
 /jumpserver other.testnet.com NEW This server is going down for maintenance, please use other.testnet.com instead.
 *Wait 10 minutes*
 /jumpserver other.testnet.com ALL This server is going down for maintenance, please use other.testnet.com instead.
 */die*

Or if you have any SSL clients use '/' and also specify an SSL server:
 /msg OperServ GLOBAL blah.testnet.com is going down for maintenance, please switch to another server
 /jumpserver other.testnet.com/ssl.testnet.com:6697 NEW This server is going down for maintenance, please use other.testnet.com instead.
 *Wait 10 minutes*
 /jumpserver other.testnet.com/ssl.testnet.com:6697 ALL This server is going down for maintenance, please use other.testnet.com instead.
 */die*
